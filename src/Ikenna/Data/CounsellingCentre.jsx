    title: "Group Counselling",
    description: `All groups require a pre-group screening to learn more about the group and whether or not it will meet individuals' particular needs. A therapy group consists of a small number of people, usually not more than eight or ten, and one or two trained group Counsellor(s). Group therapy offers a unique opportunity for joining a small group of people who share common concerns. The purpose of the group is to provide a safe as well as challenging place in which to work on personal and interpersonal concerns. Members can discuss perceptions of each other and give and receive feedback on how they are perceived by others. Therapy groups are different from other groups because everything that happens in the group is confidential; what is talked about or disclosed is not discussed outside the group.

      Establishing a level of trust allows group members to talk openly and honestly. The group members and therapists work together to establish trust and commitment to the group. The first few sessions usually focus on the establishment of trust, as well as other ground rules for the group. Groups are designed to foster active learning, a place to work on issues rather than just talk about them. Members often experience in the group the same difficulties they have elsewhere. The group, with the help of the therapist, is able to give support and understanding, offer suggestions, or gently confront the person. Groups offer opportunities to experiment with different ways of communicating with others and to try new behaviors. Those who benefit most are usually those who take an active part in the process and who allow themselves to give and receive honest, helpful feedback. Group counselling also provides opportunities to learn that others have similar difficulties and to also learn about oneself as others work on their own problems. In an atmosphere of mutual concern, members can care about and help each other.`,

    title: "Crisis Counselling",
    description: `University students typically encounter a great deal of stress (i.e., academic, social, family, and financial, etc.) during their time on campus. While most students cope successfully with the demands of college life, for some, the pressures can become overwhelming and unmanageable. Students in difficulty have a number of resources available to them. These include close friends, relatives, the chaplain, and coaches. In fact, anyone who is seen as caring and trustworthy may be a potential resource in times of trouble. Competent clinical professionals who can assist students in times of personal crisis are available at Hensard University. Staff at the Centre can also provide debriefing for traumatic events that may occur on campus, such as in the student’s Halls of Residence, or in an academic department for faculty and staff.`,

      "Reporting Physical and other forms of Abuse of Minors and Vulnerable Persons",
    description: `Physical or other forms of abuse of vulnerable persons will be reported to the appropriate university authorities.

    If and when a clinical staff learns of sufficient information to report abuse of a vulnerable person, a report will be made. When possible and deemed advisable, the client will be told of the need to make a report and will be given the option of self-reporting with the support of the clinical counsellor or staff involved. The staff will discuss the action taken with a supervisor or the Director or during a case consultation meeting.`,

    title: "Student Practicum and Internship Experiences",
    description: `The Hensard University Center is an available facility to students of Hensard University Psychology Department and appropriate departments of other universities to participate in counselling practicum and internship, which provides an intensive supervised experience in counselling with individuals, groups, and/or couples. The practicum students are exposed to the process and conduct of clinical assessments, psycho-education, consultations, and crisis intervention services.

    These courses are designed to help students gain increased competence as counsellors/therapists-in-training, as well as to expose them to a variety of clinical activities and topical issues. Eligibility of an interested applicant is based on criteria set by both Hensard University Center and the academic department of the student. Academic programs may include psychology and counselling.
    
    These supervised experiential opportunities provide students from the appropriate academic programmes opportunity for development and expansion of basic counselling and psychotherapeutic skills, promote insight regarding human development, behavior and motivation, greater awareness of ethical issues, and an increased sense of professional competence. Practicum/internship students obtain counselling experience under the individual supervision of professional staff members of Hensard University Center. In addition, they have opportunities to co-lead groups and participate in various educational and outreach activities. Through the training experience, students develop their clinical and consultative skills so that they can take on new professional roles.
    
    The philosophy that guides both student practicum and internship programmes is the practitioner-scholar model, which is grounded in “learning by doing”, utilizing research findings to direct the counselling process. Practicum/internship students are engaged in multiple activities, which give them experience in individual, couple and group counselling, testing, and other related functions at the centre. The Hensard University Center believes that the greatest trainee growth transpires through ongoing feedback in a sensitive and supportive climate.
    
    Practicum/internship students also work in a supervisory capacity to one another through case conferences, training seminars, and case review meetings. It is the aim of the Center that the training program assists each student to develop professionally, ethically, and therapeutically so that she or he becomes a competent clinician.`,
