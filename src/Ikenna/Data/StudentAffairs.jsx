    title: "GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF HALLS OF RESIDENCE",
    description: `Hensard University provides full residential facilities for all students to ensure that they live a life of dignity which is void of unnecessary challenges. The Students Affairs’ Department handles the allocation of students into the Halls of Residence. Presently, there are Ten (10) Residential Halls in Hensard University, comprising of 5 male Halls and 5 female Halls. The students’ hostel facility can effectively accommodate 9,150 students. In each of the ten Halls of Residence, are ancillary spaces such as Common Rooms, Butteries, Tuck Shops, Telephone Rooms, Beauty Salons, Hall Offices and Administrative Offices.

In each of the Halls of Residence are two Hall officers who apart from maintaining law and order also provide guidance to the students. They are duly supported by Hall Assistants.

The belief of leadership of royalty for the status of living of our students has led to the mandatory one man - one bed space philosophy driven by the Department. Neither squatting nor swapping of bed spaces is permitted.

Our Hall allocation formula is not only gender sensitive, but it is also geared towards the required Excellence in Academics and Character. Towards this end, the Department ensures that allocation takes into cognizance:
- The courses offered by students assigned to specific halls, wings, floors, and rooms.
- The character and core-value alignment of each student – to forestall the pairing of two students with conflicting character.
- The University’s drive for good peer mentorship and academic advising.`,

    title: "DISCIPLINE",
    description: `The Department also has in place the apparatus for the regulation of Students’ conduct and discipline.

Each student is given a copy of Students’ Handbook which contains the guidelines for students’ expected conduct on campus and the penalties for their violation. These guidelines put in place are a set of rules and regulations called the ‘University Royal Laws’, designed to help every student enjoy a successful tenure here at Hensard University.

All the rules and regulations explicitly stated in the Student Handbook of Hensard University are designed to groom and not to grieve. None of the regulations put in place is with the sole intent of punishing but tailored towards polishing our products, the students. These guidelines range from alignment to proper dress code and conducts during examinations; to policies on residency. In recent times, Management has approved that any form of Examination Misconduct be decisively dealt with. The essence of this is to ensure the quality of our certificate and the students’ moral character and conduct are molded in a positive way for them to assume their leadership status with dignity.

The high demand placed on discipline as a fundamental requirement for making a total graduate as embedded in the core values of Hensard University makes it imperative to pursue it with the required doggedness.

To power this effectively, the following crop of Staff and Students are adequately used:
- Administrative Staff of the Department
- Hall Staff (Officers & Assistants)
- Students’ Representatives at the following levels:
  - Apex Students’ Body
  - Halls of Residence
  - Revolutionary (Disciplinary) Squad
Apart from the enforcement of high-level Discipline, the Department also serves as an arbiter on all issues concerning our students both within and outside the Campus.`,

    description: `Qualitative Recreational Activities is an avenue for dissipating youthful energy in a beneficial but less compelling way. It helps in freeing persons from engagement in anti-social vices.
