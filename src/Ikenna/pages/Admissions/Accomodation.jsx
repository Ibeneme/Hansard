              Students can either use accommodation provided by the University,
              live at home, or arrange their own accommodation. In terms of
              proximity and ease of access to university resources, the campus
              accomodation is the preferrable option due to the location of the
              university.

                    Providing a space that serves as a home away from home is
                    our priority at Baze University. Our campus accommodation
                    options are designed with the utmost consideration for the
                    studentsâ€™ welfare. Students will be housed in either
                    one-person, or two-person per rooms hostel accommodation.
                    The cost will depend on the number of students sharing, and
                    the nature of the facilities. Private accommodation (one
                    person per room) costs N715,412.50* per semester. Shared
                    accommodation (two persons per room) costs N357,706.25* per
                    semester.
