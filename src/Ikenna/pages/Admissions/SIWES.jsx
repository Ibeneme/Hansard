              The Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) is a crucial
              component of higher education in Nigeria, aimed at bridging the
              gap between theoretical knowledge gained in the classroom and
              practical skills required in the workplace. SIWES serves as a
              platform for students to gain hands-on experience in their chosen
              fields, fostering personal and professional development.
